    "Write your own Random Walk MCMC algorithm from scratch. Don't worry if it is slow or inefficient - this exercise is about intuition building, not results. Use your sampler to fit a line to the data and generate samples from the posterior. For a first pass, run the sampler for a fixed number of steps, $N$. Then, modify the sampler to automatically stop running when a target number of effective samples $N_{\\rm eff}$ has been reached."

For Nested Sampling, you will also need to write a prior transform function; the `dynesty` documentation has a clear explanation of how to do this. Play around with using different priors (e.g. Gaussian, Uniform, Log-Uniform) to get a feel for the syntax of the different packages."

    "Generate a sample of 100 randomly distributed points inside a 2D square. \n",

    "### 1b) Distances in low dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the pairwise distances between all of the points, in d-dimensions, for two points x_i and y_i, this quantity is\n",

    "$$ |x - y| = \\sqrt{\\Sigma (x_i - y_i)^2} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Plot the distribution of these distances. Do you notice anything interesting? Is a \"special value\" picked out?\n",

    "### 1d) Extending to d-dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider the difference between picking a point located in a d-dimensional sphere vs in a d-dimensional cube. To do this, calculate and plot the the difference between the volume of a cube centered at the origin and going from [-1, 1] and the volume of a unit-radius sphere as the dimension d of the space increases. Possibly helpful formula: \n",

    "$$ Sphere: V_d = \\frac{\\pi^{d/2}}{\\frac{d}{2} \\Gamma(\\frac{d}{2})} R^d$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where R is the radius of the sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Cube: V_d = L^d $$\n",

    "and L is the length of a side.\n",

    "### 1e) Sampling in d-dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the problem of sampling in high-dimensions. If we use a uniform prior on every parameter, our expectation is that we will well sample the parameter space simply by picking in a \"uniform way\". Calculate the ratio of volume contained in an annulus between $R$ and $R - \\epsilon$ for d = 1-20 and plot this. Interpret your result in terms of a sampling problem. Are uniform priors a good choice in higher dimensions? Why or why not?"

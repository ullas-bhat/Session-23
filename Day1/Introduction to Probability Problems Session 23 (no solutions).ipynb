Behind one of the doors is a large prize (a car, dream vacation, etc.) while the contestant goes home empty handed if they pick either of the other doors. The gameshow host then opens one of the doors that does not contain the prize. \n",

In this sense, probability theory is a new kind of logic, and not statements about long run frequencies of events. In this problem, you'll explore the boolean logic that forms the basis for this perspective. While interesting for the development of probability theory, these are also useful skills for general programming tasks. \n",

    "Start by writing down the equations of motion for the coin as it moves through the air (and rotates). Once you have done that, plot the 'pre-image' (space of initial conditions) that lead to H and T outcomes. Explain why coins have a 1/2 H and 1/2 T long-run distribution and speculate on the origin of randomness. "
